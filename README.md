## Who am I?
I am a junior high school student from Shanghai, China, love computer, start writing code in 2019.Now there are many project bugs that I have repaired my own but not submitted with Pull Request. Next, I will try to learn PHP and C ++ languages.

## What's I'm doing?
Shanghai's study pressure is big, I need to prepare for the high school entrance examination. Only in the winter and summer vacation and statutory holidays have time to modify the bug.
